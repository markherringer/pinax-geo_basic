Buyer Beware
------------

I am working with this with my experimental branch of pinax in my spare time.  
It should also work with pinax-trunk but I haven't tried recently.

The necessary resources are here::

    http://github.com/skyl

I haven't properly packaged the young parts.

Go to your apps dir and run:

    git clone git://github.com/skyl/django-geoms.git geoms
    git clone git://github.com/skyl/django-world.git world
    git clone git://github.com/skyl/django-olwidget.git olwidget

You have to have geodjango, yada, yada.
